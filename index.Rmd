##  AI-based tools are powerful, but it is most effective **when used in combination with human expertise.**

- **Improve prompt engineering:** Knowing the underlying concepts helps in framing better questions and guiding AI to give accurate and relevant outputs

- **Evaluate AI-generated outputs:**  To critically assess whether AI-generated results are valid and make sense for your problem

Determine **which natural seed (Species A, B, or C) is most effective in reducing turbidity** in water samples.

- The tests were carried out, using artificial turbid
water with conventional jar test apparatus.

## Data

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Treatment <- c("A", "B", "C")
TRE <- c(10, 55, 80)
df <- data.frame(Tratment=Treatment,
                 TRE = TRE)
df |> knitr::kable()
```

- Statistical conclusions cannot be drawn based on one replicate.

## Nature of your research problem


---

## Statistical Inference: (Point and Interval Estimates)

Suppose you collect daily pH measurements from the Chicago River over a year. You want to **estimate** the average pH level of the river for the year.

> Point Estimate

> Interval Estimate (Confidence Interval)

Eg:  A 95% confidence interval for the mean pH might be (7.0, 7.4). 

---

## Statistical Inference:  Hypothesis Testing

Suppose you are analyzing water quality data from the Chicago River and want to determine whether there is a significant difference in the average pH levels during the winter and summer months.

$$H_0: \mu_{winter} = \mu_{summer}$$

$$H_1: \mu_{winter} \neq \mu_{summer}$$

---

## Forecasting

Measure the pH level of water at a specific location daily at 10 PM over a two-year period. You are interested in forecasting the  pH level in the upcoming months based on historical data.

---

## Spatial Interpolation

Suppose you have pH level measurements from various monitoring stations along the Chicago River, and you want to estimate the pH levels at unobserved locations between these stations.

---

## Cluster Analysis Problem

- You have collected water quality data from various locations along the Chicago River, including multiple parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity, temperature, and nitrate concentration. 

- The goal is to identify clusters of locations with similar water quality profiles, which could help in identifying areas with potential pollution sources or regions requiring special attention for water management.

---

## Making Predictions

Predict the pH level of a river location based on various environmental and infrastructural features.
